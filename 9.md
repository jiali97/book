### 9 Palindrome Number

> Revert half of the numberï¼š Since we divided the number by 10, and multiplied the reversed number by 10, when the original number is less than the reversed number, it means we've processed half of the number digits.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if x < 0 or (x % 10 == 0 and x != 0):
            return False
        revertVal = 0
        while(x > revertVal):
            revertVal = revertVal * 10 + x % 10
            x /= 10
        return x == revertVal or x == revertVal/10
```
